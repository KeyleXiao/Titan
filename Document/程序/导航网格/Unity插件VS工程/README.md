## Project Archive

This project is no longer being maintained. It has been transferred here from Google Code for archival purposes only.

If you wish to continue development on your own fork there are two areas that will need attention.  The version of [Recast Navigation](https://github.com/memononen/recastnavigation) used by CAINav is significantly out-of-date and will require API changes as part of the upgrade.  If you'll be using the [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/unity) integration, Unity 5.x obsoletes a lot of API's from 4.x and earlier.  Expect some necessary changes, especially in the Unity Editor components.
